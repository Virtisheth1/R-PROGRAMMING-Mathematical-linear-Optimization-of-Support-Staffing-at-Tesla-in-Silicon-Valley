# Mathematical-linear-Optimization-with-R-of-Support-Staffing-at-Tesla-in-Silicon-Valley

In our project, "Mathematical Linear Optimization with R for Support Staffing at Tesla in the Heart of Silicon Valley," we addressed the critical challenge of optimizing staffing schedules while minimizing operating costs at Tesla's 
call center. our objective was to determine the ideal number of full-time English-speaking agents, full-time Spanish-speaking agents, and part-time agents required for each 2-hour shift. 

Utilizing linear optimization techniques and mathematical modeling in R, we meticulously structured our analysis around the operational demands across different time slots. By formulating an optimization model, we aimed to minimize 
operating costs while ensuring adequate coverage for incoming calls during each shift.

The heart of our project revolved around strategic staffing decisions. We extensively analyzed diverse shift requirements, factoring in the varying demand for agents based on language preferences and working hours. The optimization model
generated insights into the optimal number of agents, distinguishing between full-time English and Spanish-speaking agents alongside part-time staff, for different time slots. These calculations were pivotal in determining the minimum 
operational cost needed to fulfill all call center requirements effectively.

Moreover, our analysis expanded to explore scenarios involving a combination of full-time and part-time agents, reiterating our commitment to finding the most cost-efficient staffing solution across different time intervals.
The mathematical rigor underpinning our approach showcased the versatility of optimization techniques in real-world staffing scenarios.

Furthermore, our project delved into assessing the wage rates for bilingual agents. Through our calculations and optimization model, we identified the maximum percentage increase in the hourly wage rate for bilingual agents over
monolingual ones, without inflating the total operating costs. This analysis provided crucial insights into cost-effective incentive structures for multilingual staff, enabling strategic decision-making in resource allocation without 
compromising cost-efficiency.

Our project's foundation in R programming and mathematical concepts facilitated a robust and data-driven approach to address staffing optimization, offering Tesla's call center a framework to make informed decisions regarding workforce 
management while optimizing operational expenses.
